# ULTRAKILL your terminal

To use this you need [fastfetch](https://github.com/fastfetch-cli/fastfetch), it's not neofetch but it's better and maintained

To install you can run this quick script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/namedottxt/ULTRAKILL-fetch
cd ULTRAKILL-fetch
python install.py
```

Or for a manual install place the config file in your `home/<user>/.config/fastfetch` folder on Linux or `ProgramData/fastfetch` on Windows

All you need is the `config.jsonc` file but I also added ULTRAKILL's font (VCR OSD) if you wanna use it in your terminal and the V1 ASCII art
